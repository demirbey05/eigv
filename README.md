# eigv: Visualizing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

**IMPORTANT: This README written by AI.**

`eigv` is a Python project dedicated to providing a clear and intuitive understanding of eigenvalues and eigenvectors through visualization. This project helps to demystify these fundamental concepts of linear algebra by showing their geometric interpretation.

## Features

- **Vector Space Generation:** Create a 2D vector space to visualize transformations.
- **Geometric Interpretation:** See how a matrix transformation affects a vector space.
- **Eigenvector Visualization:** Plot eigenvectors alongside the transformed vector space to see how they remain in the same direction.
- **Educational Tool:** Ideal for students, educators, and anyone looking to build a stronger intuition for linear algebra concepts.
